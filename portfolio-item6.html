          A web application that predicts product demand by using classification
          rules and Bayes Theorem for probability and statistics. The iterative
          waterfall model was used for development. The website used C#, ASP.NET
          4.0 and Visual Studio for front end development and MS SQL server for
          backend.Proposed system is a web enabled application which helps the
          business to know the product demand before manufacturing. Here for the
          prediction of product demand we make use of data mining technique
          called as classification rules. Proposed system is an automated system
          that predicts the demand of the product. The proposed system helps the
          business to get the best profit. By using this system the business
          entity can avoid the manufacturing of less demand products. The system
          uses Na√Øve-Bayes theorem and classification rules to predict the
          demand of the product by going through historical data and sales data
          of the company. This prediction mechanism will help the company
          determine which products will be a success in current market. In this
          case we are considering mobile phones, and the proposed system will
          determine the desirable features customers expect from their phones.
          And by considering these features the system determines whether to
          produce the new product or not. The proposed system helps the company
          to sell its goods more efficiently. This system helps to sell 80-85%
          of its produced goods, compared to 50-55% sales of the system that
          does not use product demand forecasting. Hence by using the proposed
          system the company sales will increase up to 30-35% from the previous
          sales record and it also reduces the cost of production considerably.
